# About 

- I have over a decade of experience in software engineering and many years of leading and building teams of different sizes.

- I've worked on very different products, markets, and technologies, for high-profile clients like PepsiCo, Philip Morris International, Liberty Global, Vorwerk, and start-ups at various stages.

- I developed, led, architect, and distributed over twenty native, cross-platform apps and games, numerous web apps, web services, and tools.

- Sometimes, things I've done [get attention from people](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/official-cookidoo-app/id714004506) and even collect awards like [Red Dot](https://www.red-dot.org/project/thermomix-tm6-41286) or [Golden Drum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87IOP8ctm6Q).

- I've been building products with Flutter that millions of people use since 2017, so I'm one of the early adopters of Flutter.
